    "## 1.1 The Reward Engineering Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time in the world of Artificial Intelligence, researchers faced a tricky situation—really two problems rolled into one—especially when trying to teach robots complex, real-world skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The LLM's High-Level View** Large Language Models (LLMs) like `GPT-4` are fantastic thinkers and planners. They can manage the \"big picture,\" like deciding the steps needed to complete a complex task. But when it came to teaching a robot the detailed, low-level movements - the actual tiny twists and turns required for something precise like dexterous pen spinning-LLMs hit a wall. They could plan the action, but they couldn't control the fingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Reward Function Nightmare** To teach a robot anything through **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, you need a reward function - a detailed rulebook that tells the robot if it's doing a good job. Unfortunately, designing these rulebooks is notoriously difficult for humans, even for experts. Researchers often spend agonising amounts of time using manual trial-and-error, and despite all that effort, the resulting rewards are often suboptimal or lead to unintended behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **In essence:** We had a brilliant planner (the LLM) that couldn't handle the fine details, and a vital rulebook (the reward function) that was nearly impossible for humans to write perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The Key Breakthrough: The LLM Becomes the Reward Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "The `EUREKA` paper resolved these problems with a genuinely innovative idea: **Instead of asking the LLM to control the robot, let's ask the LLM to write the perfect rulebook (the reward function) itself.** `EUREKA` introduced an algorithm that achieves human-level reward design by turning the LLM into an expert reward engineer. This was possible due to three main innovations working together, creating an automated, self-improving loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1. Code-Writing Power** `EUREKA` leveraged the LLM's ability to generate executable, free-form code. It didn't just fill in a simple template; it wrote complex software programs that defined the reward function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2. Evolutionary Search** The LLM didn't just write one reward function; it would generate multiple candidates and iteratively propose refinements, performing a kind of automated evolutionary optimisation over the reward code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3. Reward Reflection (Self-Correction)** The system would train an RL policy using the new reward function and then automatically provide the LLM with textual feedback detailing exactly why the reward worked or failed (e.g., *\"The penalty term is too weak\"*). This enabled the LLM to progressively correct and improve its code in a targeted way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Result:** By combining the code-writing brilliance of LLMs with a system for rapid self-correction and iteration, `EUREKA` autonomously generated reward functions that often outperformed those written by human experts. This allowed researchers, for the first time, to acquire skills like rapid pen spinning on complex robotic hands."

    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. LLM Dependency\n",
    "- Requires API access and costs money\n",
    "- Model deprecation risk\n",
    "- Vendor lock-in\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Single Environment\n",
    "- Only tested on CartPole (simple task)\n",
    "- Cannot claim broad generalization\n",
    "- Original EUREKA tested 29 tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Computational Cost\n",
    "- 12 training runs × 3-5 minutes each\n",
    "- Scales poorly (100 rewards = 6.5 hours)\n",
    "- Not practical for rapid iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Reward Interpretation\n",
    "- Absolute reward values are meaningless\n",
    "- Only relative comparisons matter\n",
    "- Can be confusing (986 > 500 max?)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Multi-Modal Reward Design\n",
    "Incorporate visual information (videos of successful execution) using vision-language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Reward Verification\n",
    "Formal methods to verify reward correctness and safety properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Transfer Learning\n",
    "Meta-learn reward generation across tasks for rapid adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "Interactive refinement based on human preferences and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Broader Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive:**\n",
    "- Democratizes RL (non-experts can design rewards)\n",
    "- Accelerates research and applications\n",
    "- Discovers novel reward formulations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks:**\n",
    "- Misaligned rewards harder to detect\n",
    "- Loss of human oversight\n",
    "- Economic impact on RL expertise"

    "\n",
    "### Member 1\n",
    "*\"Working on this project deepened my understanding of both LLMs and RL. Seeing EUREKA discover better rewards than our hand-crafted baseline was genuinely exciting. The most challenging part was debugging the LLM prompt engineering, but seeing it work made it worthwhile.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Member 2\n",
    "*\"This project gave me hands-on experience with the complete RL pipeline. The most surprising result was how consistently EUREKA improved across iterations—the reflection mechanism really works! I learned that reward design is both an art and a science.\"*\n",

    "- All code was written by us or properly attributed\n",
    "- We used OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API as specified in the project\n",
